# YleSearchProgramsChallenge
Test project for searching programs from the Yle API.

The task is to search programs from the Yle API:
http://developer.yle.fi/tutorials.html

The application should have an input field where the user can provide what programs to search for (a search query).
The Finnish title of each result should be displayed in a scrollable list.
When submitting a search, only the first 10 results should be retrieved from the API.
When the user scrolls to the last few items in the list, the next 10 results should be appended to the list. An example for this type of scrolling can be seen here: http://9gag.com/

Technologies to use:
- Unity UI
- UnityWebRequest
- Any JSON library you prefer
